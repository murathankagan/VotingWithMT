# Voting App With Meta Transaciton

## Steps to install

### Clone to local

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/murathankagan/VotingWithMT.git
 cd VotingWithMT/contracts/vote
 forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts 
```
 Ä°f you don't have Foundry You can setup in your environment with the following [link](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation): 

### Configure the Contracts


```solidity
    function setUp() public {

        bytes4 voteContentSignature = bytes4(keccak256("voteContent(uint256,uint256)"));
        bytes4[] memory allowedFunctionSignatures = new bytes4[](1);
        allowedFunctionSignatures[0] = voteContentSignature;

        uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY");
        vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);
        
        address sponsorAddress = 0x97E7f2B08a14e4C0A8Dca87fbEB1F68b397c91df;
        
        Forwarder forwarder = new Forwarder(allowedFunctionSignatures, sponsorAddress);

        address forwarderAddress = address(forwarder);


        Vote vote = new Vote(forwarderAddress);


        vm.stopBroadcast();

    }
```

- In the ``setUp()`` function in the ``Vote.s.sol`` file in the ``/script`` path, add the functions you want users to pay gas fee from the ``bytes4 voteContentSignature = bytes4(keccak256("voteContent(uint256,uint256)"));`` section as in the ``voteContent(uint256,uint256)`` example and include them in the ``allowedFunctionSignatures[0] = voteContentSignature;`` array.
- Followed by 
```bash
source .env
forge script script/Vote.s.sol:VoteScript --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast```
and paste the addresses of the deployed contracts ``Forwarder.sol`` and ``Vote.sol`` into the ``Forwarder`` and ``Vote`` sections of the ``/vote/src/web3/deploy.json`` path.
